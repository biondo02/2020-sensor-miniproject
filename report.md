My teammate and I have not used Python prior to this assignment. Therefore, some python conventions that may be immediately obvious to those who have learned the language formally may not be followed. However, this also means we got more out of this project than our peers who may already be practiced in Python. First, we analysed the code provided to us. A few things stood out to us, for instance Add.argument and Asyncio, so we began our endeavor by researching the keywords we were not familiar with. Python proved to be a very approachable language, and once we began to feel  comfortable with the general syntax the coding itself became much easier. This familiarity allowed us to implement code of our own, such as the pandas function which proved critical to analysing the data. 
The zeroth task set out for us was very manageable, as we both have had experience with github before. Unfortunately, one of our import functions was not working correctly and therefore it took awhile to truly get the first code working. This was solved by writing the import function into the code directly rather than use it in a path. The first task could be accomplished with only a few lines of code in client.py, which would append the file we created by adding any information as it came in. In the second task, we relied on pandas to organize the data into probability density functions. With these probability density functions graphed, we can gauge easily the main characteristics of the data. With the data organized, we can also use functions on it to find its median, variance, mean, etc. For task 3, we set a standard deviation from the mean of the data as a bound, and compared each point's absolute difference to this bound to see which were outliers. If it was an outlier, python would print its timestamp, and add it to an array which would later be dropped. Once the faulty data points were dropped, it was trivial to run similar functions on them as in task 2 to find the new characteristics of the outlier-less data. 

		

Task 0

Greeting String: ECE Senior Capstone IoT simulator.




Task 1

In order to accomplish task 1 we added additional code to the client.py and called the function by using the command python ws_client.py -l SensorData20.txt in order to write the data to the file SensorData20.txt

Task 3



				
				Lab1			Class1 		Office
1.
% of Anomalies  		3.802			3.861		.704
Mean Temp			20.998 			27.018		23.029
Variance of Temp 		0.138			0.737		3.795

2. Does a persistent change in temperature always indicate a failed sensor?

           No. Our algorithm detects anomalies by comparing the data points to the other 
           data points through standard deviation to the mean. If a persistent change occurs 
           This will affect the variance and our algorithm will not flag it as outliers.
           Whether a persistent change indicates a failing sensor that is not flagged as 
           an outlier is a possible false negative. 
       
3. What are the possible bounds for each room?

In all three rooms, we use 1.5 standard deviations to get rid of outlier data. 
In the office, that is 2.22% of data points. 13 degrees from the median. In the lab, this gets rid of 6.25% of data points. 0.5 degrees from the median. In the class, this gets rid of 2% of data points. 6 degrees from the median. 

Task 4
	
1. How is this simulation reflective of the real world?

This simulation approaches real world scenarios. By simulating real world sensors, asking for the data being produced by those sensors is a common occurrence in many products. It is also realistic to have some faulty data within the data set, as sensors do not obtain their information perfectly. Additionally, in a world of social distancing, it's not inconceivable to be writing code for sensors far away from one’s physical self. 

2. How is this simulation deficient? What factors does it fail to account for?
 
This simulation is ultimately using make believe sensors. That means they will not turn off, they will not run into real word errors, and they will not have product specific quirks. Any outliers will be simple randomly generated numbers, not a string of numbers created from a specific error. The made up sensors will be much neater than their real world counterparts. With that being said, real world sensors will most likely have software recommendations for how to analyse those sensors data. Creating our own software from scratch is unusual in today’s age. 

3. How is the difficulty of initially using this Python websockets library as compared to a compiled language e.g. C++ websockets?

This was made easier as a non compiled language, as every time we wanted to test our code we did not need to run it or 20 minutes to get 20 minutes of data. Instead of needing to run it each time, we would just save the code and use the same data for each iteration of our code. Therefore, we could see in real time what was happening to our code, by using functions like print to display the variable we were currently working on. C## may have needed us to run for the data file each time, adding 20 minutes for each iteration of code. 

4. Would it be better to have the server poll the sensors, or the sensors reach out to the server when they have data?

If the server polled the sensors, it would need to be constantly asking for data. Even when the sensors are off. So, it would be more efficient to only send over data when the sensor is on and collecting data. Therefore, it makes the most sense for the sensor to send data to the server.
